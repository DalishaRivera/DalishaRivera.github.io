## About Me

My name is Dalisha Rivera-Rodriguez. I am a Senior who is currently enrolled at Fayetteville State University. I am expected to graduate in May of 2019 with a Computer Science major and a minor in Mathematics. I attended Hanover College my Freshman and Sophomore year where I took part in many different extracurricular activities and extensive academic work. I was originially going to only major in Mathematics and minor in Spanish; however, as a cognitive course for math I had to take the introductary course to Computer Science my Sophomore year and knew I could not pass up the opportunity to make this a career so I changed my major to Computer Science and changed my minor to Mathematics. During my Sophomore year, I proficiently learned Python, C++, and Java. I wanted to continue enhancing my new skills so over the last two years I have participated in two internships, described below.

## Internships
North Carolina Consortium for Self-Aware Machining and Metrology (December 2018 - Present)

The research I am involved in will generate new knowledge in the application of artificial intelligence to high precision part manufacture and measurment. I will specifically be working on creating concepts and ideas on how to develop a self aware machine that will have the ability to understand its current state and its surroundings with high accuracy. By doing so, the self aware machine will be able to analyze any engineering part and determine if it is up to standard or not. The goal for this research is to find a strategy that will enable manufacturing companies to overcome human internvention limitations and make the manufacturing process more effiecient. 

Software Security (Summer 2017)

I participated in a Reasearch Experience for Undergraduates(REU) internship called Science of Software at North Carolina State University. Here I worked under Dr. Laurie Williams and Chistopher Theisen to help develop scripts and visualization tools to assist developers in locating vulnerabilites within their code more effectively. With the concept of Attack Surface Approximation, we can narrow the search of where vulnerabilities lie through what is accessable by the end user (stack trace). I then assisted them in developing scripts that will parse through a online database and write the information into a CSV file. Then created an eclipse plugin that takes the CSV file information and creates a visual to assist developers find vulnerabilities in their code more effectively. 

This internship was an amazing experience because it allowed me to get more practice with coding in Java. It also allowed me to work with languages I have never worked with before such as HTML and Selenium.
