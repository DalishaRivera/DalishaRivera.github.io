## About Me

My name is Dalisha Rivera-Rodriguez. I am a Computer Science and Mathematics major with a Spanish minor. I am a rising Junior who is enrolled to attend Fayetteville State University this upcoming fall of 2017. I attended Hanover College my Freshman and Sophomore year where I took part in many extra curricular activities listed below. I was originially going to only major in Mathematics and minor in Spanish; however, as a cognitive course for math I had to take the introductary course to Computer Science my Sophomore year and knew I could not pass up the opportunity to make this a career so I picked it up as a major. In just that academic school year I proficiently learned Python, C++, and Java. I wanted to continue enhancing my newly developed skills so I participated in a summer internship for Software Security.

## Project
Software Security (Summer 2017)

I participated in a Reasearch Experience for Undergraduates(REU) internship called Science of Software at North Carolina State University. Here I worked under Dr. Laurie Williams and Chistopher Theisen to help develop scripts and visualization tools to assist developers in locating vulnerabilites within their code more effectively. With the concept of Attack Surface Approximation, we can narrow the search of where vulnerabilities lie through what is accessable by the end user (stack trace). I then assisted them in developing scripts that will parse through a online database and write the information into a CSV file. Then created an eclipse plugin that takes the CSV file information and creates a visual to assist developers find vulnerabilities in their code more effectively. 

This internship was an amazing experience because it allowed me to get more practice with coding in Java. It also allowed me to work with languages I have never worked with before such as HTML and Selenium.
